Secure Checkout Process: Users can book a property with a simplified and safe checkout experience.

User Authentication: Sign-up, login, and profile management.

<!-- 📄 Primary Page Descriptions  -->

| Page Name                 | Description                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Property Listing View** | Displays a grid of available properties with filters like price, location, etc.       |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Shows full property details including images, description, reviews, and booking form. |
| **Simple Checkout View**  | Provides a clean interface for entering payment details and confirming the booking.   |

<!-- 💡 Importance of a User-Friendly Design -->

A user-friendly interface is crucial for a booking platform. It reduces friction in the user journey, enhances trust, and boosts conversion rates. Clear navigation, fast response times, and consistent visual elements help users feel confident when browsing and booking properties. A good design also improves accessibility, making the platform inclusive and easier to use for all users.
